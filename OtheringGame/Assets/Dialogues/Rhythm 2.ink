//Father
You have helped look after me since you were 5 and have been so patient with me. 

I will never see you grow up and I wish I was healthy enough to at least see you achieve something for yourself.

Please just remember me and the memories we have together.

//Player (CONT'D)
I promise I will remember you..I love you, Dad.#speaker:Player #portrait:player_sad #layout:left
